# MNIST-NeuralNetwork
we will implement an L-layered deep neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset.The MNIST dataset we use here is 'mnist.pkl.gz' which is divided into training, validation and test data. The following function load_data() unpacks the file and extracts the training, validation and test data.
